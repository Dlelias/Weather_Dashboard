# Weather_Dashboard

Description
In this project I am to build a weather dashboard, which will run in the browswer and dynamically update the HTML and CSS .

The browser will use OpenWeather One Call API (https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api). From the OneWeatherAPI we are to gather the data by making specific request parameter to a URL. Once the data is retreived, any persisting data will then be stored in localsotage

Usage

The purpose of the weather dashboard is for a user to search weather in multiple cities . This could be useful especially when planning for a trip. 

The weather dashboard will search for a specific city and present the user with the current and future weather conditions in that city.  Recent searched cities will be added to a search history. 

In the weather city search the user will also be presented with the date of that weather and an icon representing the weather conditions, tempeture, humidity, and wind speed, and UV index. 
 

When a user selects to view future weather conditions for the search city.  They will be presented with a 5-day forecast, the dates , and icon represented the weather conditions, tempature, speed , and humidity. 

If the user selects the city in the search history, they will be presented with current and future conditions on the selected city.
